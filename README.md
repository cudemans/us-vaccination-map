# US vaccination map

Written in D3.js, this visualization maps the US' vaccination program. It currently uses static data but I'm working on getting it to pull from the CDC's API. Data for this project can be found [here](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_county_condensed_data)
